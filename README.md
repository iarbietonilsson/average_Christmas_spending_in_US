### **Objectives** 
1. **What works and what doesn't work with this chart?**

   **+** The line plot is the appropriate type of chart for Christmas spending per year.

   **+** I like that actual dollar amounts on each marker per year.

   **-** It is not clear what the graph is plotting. There is no title nor x axis label.
   
   **-** Dollar amounts do not include a $ Dollar sign, making it clear that it is a currency.

2. **How can you make it better?**

   To improve the visualization:
    - [x] Add a title.
    - [x] Add x-axis label. 
    - [x] Add y-axis label.
    - [x] Clean up appearance of Years on x-axis.
    - [x] Add $ Dollar signs to the marker datapoints.
    - [x] Adjust styling. 
3. **Post your alternative on the discussions page.**
